# Arvato_customer_segmentation_mail-target
# Capstone Project for Udacity - Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree Program*

## Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to build a model to predict which 
individuals are most likely to convert into customers for a mail-order sales company in Germany.

1. Customer Segmentation Report
In this project, I began the project by using unsupervised learning methods to analyze attributes of established 
customers and the general population in order to create customer segments. 

2. Supervised Learning Model
I used the previous analysis to build a machine learning model that predicts whether or not each individual will respond to the campaign.

3. Kaggle Competition
After submitting the prediction to Kaggle, this project work was ranked at 30th.

## How the project is organized

The file "ArvatoProjectCombined.ipynb" contains 3 steps together: 

1. Data exploration, cleaning and pre-processing
2. Customer Segmentation
3. Customer prediction

The notebooks expect that the following files are present in the `data` folder:
- Udacity_AZDIAS_052018.csv
- Udacity_CUSTOMERS_052018.csv
- Udacity_MAILOUT_052018_TEST.csv
- Udacity_MAILOUT_052018_TRAIN.csv

**The data is the property of Bertelsmann Arvato Analytics and it is not included in the repository.**

Also, these two metadata files are provided:
- DIAS Attributes-Values2017.xlsx
- DIAS Information Levels - Attributes 2017.xlsx
